<!-- How to get to the conference -->

The event will take place in Odaiba, Tokyo at [AIST Tokyo Waterfront Annex building, Tokyo](https://goo.gl/maps/Fa35PNVFmjaun7dN7).

We suggest taking the Yurikamome Line to Telecom Center Station, which is a mere 5-minute walk away.

Alternatively, you may also consider taking the Rinkai Line to Tokyo Teleport Station, from where it's approximately a 15-minute walk to the destination.
